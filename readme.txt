The fastest way to manage meta-data for your wordpress images.

== Description ==

A very light-weight plugin, designed to make updating meta-values (title, caption, description and alternate text) more efficient, by providing one central table of imagery and a duplicate button to copy this information across fields.


**Simple, Straight-Forward Meta Updates**

All current imagery is presented in a table, sortable by TITLE or DATE.

* Update Title, Caption, Description or Alt values independently, or
* ...update one, and copy across to the other fields.
* Updates are performed on-the-fly, so no lengthy reloads are necessary.
* A quick reference thumbnail is presented in-line to popup individual images for review.
* An edit link is provided beside each image to fine-tune editing, using traditional wordpress administration.
* Missing images are highlighted and an additional delete button is provided for safe/quick file grooming.
* Quick-edit dropdowns are provided to open/edit posts where images are attached, or embedded into the post content.

== Installation ==

1. Install ImageMeta either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server (in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory).
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Access ImageMeta in the Admin > Tools flyout, and away you go!

== Screenshots ==

1. The ImageMeta table with examples of image meta-data that can be directly edited, or easily copied across all fields and saved with the click of a button.
2. Missing images that can be safely removed.
